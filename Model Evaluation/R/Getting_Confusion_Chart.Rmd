### Scope
The scope of this notebook is to provide instructions on how to get the Confusion Chart using the R API. The Code below will work **only for Multiclass Classification Projects**. For Binary Classification Projects, use the <code>GetRocCurve</code> command.

This notebook will not cover creation of a DataRobot Project. It takes as a given that you have created a project using DataRobot's R API.

### Background

The confusion matrix for a multiclass classification project will be a ùëÅ√óùëÅ matrix, with the left axis showing the true class of an observation and the top axis showing the class assigned to the observation by the model. Each element ùëñ,ùëó of the matrix would be the number of items with true class ùëñ that were classified as being in class ùëó.

Some important definitions: 

**F1**: The F1 score for each class.

**Precision**: The precision statistic for each class.

**Recall**: The recall statistic for each class.

**Actual Count**: The number of records for each class that actually are that class.

**Predicted Count**: The number of times each class was predicted.

### Requirements

- R version 3.6.2
-  DataRobot API version 2.16.0. 
Small adjustments might be needed depending on the R version and DataRobot API version you are using.

Full documentation of the R package can be found here:¬†https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datarobot/index.html

It is assumed you already have a DataRobot <code>Project</code> object and a DataRobot <code>Model </code> object.

#### Import Packages
```{r results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(datarobot)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#This piece of code will not show
ConnectToDataRobot(endpoint = "https:YOUR_DATAROBOT_HOSTNAME", 
                   token = "YOUR_API_KEY")

project <- GetProject("YOUR_PROJECT_IDModels <- ListModels(project)
modelFrame <- as.data.frame(allModels)
metric <- modelFrame$validationMetric
if (project$metric %in% c('AUC', 'Gini Norm')) {
  bestIndex <- which.max(metric)
} else {
  bestIndex <- which.min(metric)
}
model <- allModels[[bestIndex]]
model$modelType
```

#### Requesting Confusion Chart Data

```{r}
confusionChart <- GetConfusionChart(model, source = DataPartition$VALIDATION)
head(confusionChart)
```
